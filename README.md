# Beaver Lake Waterhshed
## Land and Water Uses
"Beaver Lake provides water to over 350,000 people in Arkansas". The Beaver watershed brings in people from all places to enjoy its wide range of recreational activities. The economy bordering the lake is benefited by the camping, boating, and fishing brought on by the beautiful Beaver Lake. The forested hilly terrain bordering the lake provides an aesthetic view from the lake and from the woods on the trails and campgrounds. 

The land bordering the lake contains the larger cities of Fayetteville, Rogers, and Springdale Arkansas. These cities are growing from tourism brought in by the lakes and the productivity of the industry in the area. The land is used to raise livestock like chickens, turkey, and cattle. Tyson has a large foothold in the poultry industry in the cities and the neighboring farmland. The water pumped out of the beaver watershed fuels this bustling economy with both drinking water and hydroelectric power. However, it is not just farmland that the land is used for. The lush forests in the area provide both a beautiful view and a lucrative trade when managed properly. 

The Beaver Lake Watershed is a very diverse area in regards the utilization of its resources. The potential for contamination from several sources is possible due to this. The Watershed Alliance is monitoring the waterways with the USGS and many other agencies to prevent any major issues in the future. With the growing economy in the area, this is a necessity to avoid any potential problems.

## Goals of the Project
The goals addressed by the Beaver Watershed Alliance can be found in the following bullet points. The upper three bullet points covers the entire scope of the watershed; those past the three listed are for specifically Beaver Lake.
-	“Maintain a long-term, high quality drinking water supply to meet present needs and continuing growth of the region.”
-	“Restore water quality of impaired stream and lake areas.”
-	“Minimize additional costs and regulations for people living and working in the watershed.”

## Objectives for Beaver Lake
-	“Minimize risks to public health and safety.”
-	“Minimize taste, odor, and color problems in the public drinking water supplies.”
-	“Minimize impact on water supply intakes and treatment operations.”
-	“Meet long-term needs for water supply in the region.”
-	“Maintain recreational enjoyment and ensure that recreation reflects environmentally sound stewardship of the lake.”
-	“Restore water quality in impaired areas to meet water quality standards.”
-	“Provide an economically priced water supply.” ( Beaver Watershed Alliance 2012)

## Potential Funding for Landowners
Under the Beaver Watershed Alliance, a wide range of potential funding opportunities to assist landowners in Best Management Practices is covered. Many of these funding opportunities deal with erosion prevention and control. Erosion control is an important factor in the management of pollution in the watershed. The hilly terrain is easily eroded around the lake and needs to be monitored. Many of the other funding opportunities deal with the urban development in the area. Construction runoff is increasingly becoming a problem with increase in development. Soil erosion, development, and agriculture are potential pollutants that need proactive landowners to reduce pollutant loads. Here is a list of many of those practices covered in the report published by the Beaver Watershed Alliance:
